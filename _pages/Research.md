My research interests lie in developing novel theoretically justifiable and computationally efficient methods for tackling the computation burden brought about by the sheer size of large-scale datasets. My ongoing research interests are as follows.

* Non-parametric methods
* Medical Imaging and Computer Vision
* Subsampling methods in big data
* Network Data analysis
